## Frame 8 — The brain: Pi Durable

- scene: A "PI DURABLE · THE BRAIN" core sits inside a Durable Object frame; its journal stacks steps, survives a crash glitch and resumes; then it reads the exact commit of src/auth.ts, builds a finding chip "src/auth.ts:88–94 @ 7e2d10b", and files it as issue #143.
- voiceover: "The brain is Pi Durable: an agent harness inside a Durable Object, journaling every step, so a crash never loses its place. It reads the exact commit, cites the file, the line, the SHA, and files the finding as an issue."

narrativeRole: Mechanism 3: the agent runtime is built in. Pi Durable is the brain, durable by construction, and its review is grounded in the exact commit.
keyMessage: A durable agent brain, built in, that reviews with receipts.

Adapt: keep "evidence read → artifact"; prepend the brain: a durable journal theater (the agent's steps persist through a crash) before the diff read and the auto-filed issue. Existing diff panel + issue card components may be reused.
Scene 1 (0.0–1.6s): DARK. On "brain" (0.28s) a square core block springs in at right-center: display "pi durable" with mono label "THE BRAIN · AGENT HARNESS". Mono kicker top-left "No. 09 / built-in agent runtime".
Scene 2 (1.6–3.8s): on "agent harness" (1.88–2.18s) the label underlines; on "Durable Object" (3.08–3.48s) a hairline outer frame draws around the core, labelled mono "DURABLE OBJECT", with a small chip "gpt-oss-120b · WORKERS AI".
Scene 3 (3.8–7.1s): on "journaling every step" (3.88–4.78s) a mono journal list stacks beside the core, one line per beat: "01 read src/auth.ts @ 7e2d10b ✓" · "02 diff a1f3c9e..7e2d10b ✓" · "03 check session refresh …". On "crash" (5.48s) a glitch hit tears the frame (short, orange) and the core blinks out; on "never loses its place" (5.88–6.68s) the core snaps back and the journal still shows 01–02 ✓ with "03 resumed" highlighted orange.
Scene 4 (7.1–8.9s): the core/journal slide to the right third; the src/auth.ts diff panel slides in left; on "reads the exact commit" (7.48–8.28s) an orange scan line sweeps down it and an "@ 7e2d10b" chip pins to its header.
Scene 5 (8.9–11.0s): lines 88–94 highlight; a finding chip builds token by token on its words: "src/auth.ts" (9.48s "file") → ":88–94" (9.88s "line") → " @ 7e2d10b" (10.48s "SHA").
Scene 6 (11.0–13.16s): on "files the finding as an issue" (11.28–12.38s) the chip flies right into an issue card "#143 · redirect loop on expired session · FOUND BY PI DURABLE REVIEW"; hold.

## Selected blueprint: transcript-scroll-artifact-reveal

# transcript-scroll-artifact-reveal — Transcript-Scroll Artifact Reveal

**intent**: The frame travels vertically along ONE long content surface — an agent transcript, a running task feed, an analysis document, a story draft — rendered full-bleed on a flat canvas (no device frame, no held mockup), by camera pan or element scroll; the traversal itself is the story ("look how much work happened / how much is here"), until ONE focal interaction — a file-chip click, a quote highlight, a collapsible-row expand — pivots the shot into an artifact/detail reveal: the deliverable behind the work.

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (modes: `pan-to-workspace` · `feed-rush` · `document-to-artifact` · `selection-pivot`): the x-viral AI-product grammar for "the agent did a lot of work → here's the deliverable." The long surface is the EVIDENCE (tool pills, checked progress items, task rows, headings, comps tables, story paragraphs), read at traversal pace; the artifact is the PAYOFF (full workspace with live mockup, spreadsheet with highlighted cells, inline ask-panel, sub-task stack). Reach for it when the feature's proof is the volume/depth of generated work and the beat should cash that in on one interaction — not a held device tour (`device-surface-showcase`), not a cursor-chased workflow (`cursor-ui-demo`).

**duration**: 5–11.8s (feed-rush 5.4s · pan-to-workspace 5.0s · selection-pivot 9.3s · document-to-artifact 11.75s)

**shot structure** One `[long content surface: agent chat transcript / task feed / analysis document / story doc]` sits full-bleed on a `[flat light canvas]` (goldens: warm off-white / cream / beige / plain white — the surface's own background IS the scene background); dark text with small `[accent]` marks (green verb highlights, model-tag pills, check circles, yellow cells). Three acts: TRAVERSE → HINGE → ARTIFACT. Camera discipline is the signature: at most TWO real camera moves in the whole shot, bracketing the hinge; everything else is element motion on a static frame.

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~40–60% of runtime) — establish + vertical traversal (the evidence).** The surface establishes with one small opener — a `[title]` types on / a centered `[title]` shrinks ~50% and glides to the top-left to dock as a fixed header / the frame opens tight on the `[chat panel]` — then the traversal begins: the frame travels DOWN the content (or the content streams UP through the frame), revealing progressive work in reading order: `[prompt → tool pills → checked progress items → typed summary]`, `[tagged task rows → muted tasks → checklist block]`, `[heading → paragraph → comps table → bullets]`, `[title → story paragraphs → dialogue]`. New rows may cascade in (staggered arrival) before the scroll takes over; a typed line may finish under the moving frame. Traversal texture varies by member: one continuous slow pan, a fast continuous feed rush, stepped scrolls decelerating at each stop (speed-blur between stops, content fading at frame edges), or one smooth scroll easing to a stop.
- **Scene 2 (~1–2s) — the hinge: ONE focal interaction.** The traversal settles and a single interaction pivots the shot: a `[file-attachment chip]` spring-pops in below a typed handoff line and a cursor glides in and CLICKS it; a `[sentence/quote]` gets a selection-highlight sweep and a `[tooltip pill]` spring-pops above it for the click; a `[collapsible row]` reaches the frame center and EXPANDS; or the typed `[verifier summary]` completes as the implicit trigger. This is the only interaction in the shot — the cursor (if any) appears here for the first time.
- **Scene 3 (rest) — artifact reveal + hold.** The hinge cashes in, choosing ONE reveal mechanic: a fast smoothly-DECELERATING zoom-OUT re-frames the whole `[workspace]` (the panel just traversed becomes a sidebar beside a `[live mockup]` and `[tool panel]`); an `[artifact window: spreadsheet]` scales up from small toward full frame, then a slow push-in + lateral pan settles on its `[highlighted cells]`; an `[inline panel]` expands below the highlighted line and a `[follow-up question]` types into it; or the row unfolds into a `[sub-task stack]` and the scroll settles on `[narration text]`. Optional coda: one cursor click instantly swaps a `[screen]` inside the revealed artifact (e.g. a phone tab click). Frame locks; element motion only to the end.

- Variant — _pan-to-workspace_ (001_claudeai, 5.0s): traversal is a REAL camera pan — opens tight on the chat panel, one single uninterrupted downward glide (never cutting away) over pills → checked list → typing verifier summary; hinge is the summary completing; reveal is ONE rapid decelerating zoom-out to the three-part workspace (chat-as-sidebar / phone mockup / tweaks panel); coda cursor click swaps the phone screen instantly. Exactly two camera moves total.
- Variant — _feed-rush_ (010_perplexity A, 5.4s): NO camera at all — title docks to header, five tagged rows cascade in, then a fast continuous upward ELEMENT scroll races through muted tasks and a checklist to a collapsible row; hinge is the row itself; reveal is the row expanding into a six-item sub-task stack, settling on narration. Cursorless.
- Variant — _document-to-artifact_ (010_perplexity B, 11.75s): traversal is a stepped ELEMENT scroll (static frame) — the document climbs in fast steps, decelerating at each stop, blur/fade between stops, clearing to blank canvas; hinge is a typed handoff line + file-chip pop + cursor click; reveal is the spreadsheet window scaling up then one slow continuous push-in + rightward pan onto the yellow-highlighted forecast columns.
- Variant — _selection-pivot_ (014_OpenAI, 9.3s): typed headline → document builds (bubble prompt + typed title + populating paragraphs) → one smooth upward element scroll eases to a stop; hinge is the selection-highlight sweep + the shot's ONE push-in framing the sentence + tooltip-pill click; reveal is the inline panel expanding below the line with the referenced quote and a rapidly-typed follow-up question. Camera locked at the pushed-in zoom to the end.

**motion vocabulary** continuous slow downward camera pan; fast continuous upward feed scroll; stepped document scroll decelerating at each stop; smooth scroll easing to a stop; speed-blur between scroll stops; content fade at frame edges; centered title shrinks ~50% and glides to a top-left header dock; task rows cascade in staggered; typed line / typed title / typed follow-up question (caret); green leading-verb highlights and model-tag pills riding past; checked-item strikethroughs riding past; file-attachment chip spring pop-in; tooltip pill spring pop; chat-bubble arrival; cursor glide-in + click; selection-highlight sweep across a sentence; ONE camera push-in onto the selection; fast decelerating zoom-out to the full workspace; artifact window scales up from small; slow push-in + lateral pan settling on highlighted cells; collapsible row expands into a sub-task stack; inline panel expands below the line; phone-screen instant swap on a coda tab click; frame-lock hold.

**rule mapping**

- vertical traversal by ELEMENT scroll — fast feed rush / stepped document scroll / smooth scroll-to-stop → `3d-page-scroll` (flat variant: tilt ≈ 0 — the surface's content `translateY`-scrolls to sections; the multi-phase scroll variant covers stepped stops; keep ONE ease family across all steps — `power3.out`/`power4.out` for UI-scroll feel)
- vertical traversal by CAMERA pan (transcript glide) → `viewport-change` (pan mode — the world translates up under a static frame; one continuous tween, no cuts)
- speed-blur between stepped-scroll stops → `motion-blur-streak` (blur peaks at max scroll velocity, resolves to 0 at each settle)
- which content each traversal beat reveals (stop-by-stop sequencing) → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- centered title shrinks and glides to dock as a fixed header → `gsap-effects` (one simultaneous scale + translate tween; plain two-property move, no named rule required)
- task rows cascade in staggered before the scroll takes over → `waterfall-entry` (arrival cascade; goldens use fade + slide-up — the house rule prescribes binary-opacity whip-in, adopt the house form) or `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group) for card-like rows
- typed lines — verifier summary, handoff line, document title, follow-up question, opening headline → `discrete-text-sequence` (+ `context-sensitive-cursor` for the trailing caret)
- file-attachment chip pop-in / tooltip pill pop / chat-bubble arrival → `spring-pop-entrance`
- cursor glides in, lands, clicks (hinge and coda) → `cursor-click-ripple` (+ `physics-press-reaction` to compress cursor and target together on the press)
- selection-highlight sweep across the sentence → `css-marker-patterns` (highlight sweep)
- ONE push-in onto the highlighted selection / slow push-in + lateral pan settling on highlighted cells → `coordinate-target-zoom` (measured off-center target — the lateral pan IS the counter-translate component), sequenced under `multi-phase-camera` when it follows the window scale-up
- fast decelerating zoom-OUT to the full workspace → `coordinate-target-zoom` (zoom-out variation: open at the zoomed-in framing, pull to scale 1 with `power3.out`/`power4.out`) or `viewport-change` (single continuous pull on the `cam` object)
- artifact window scales up from small toward full frame on the click → `spring-pop-entrance` (hero arrival scale-up; tune overshoot to ~0 / `power3.out` so the window reads weighty, not bouncy)
- collapsible row expands into a sub-task stack / inline panel expands below the highlighted line → `anchored-layout-expand` (in-flow accordion growth pushing subsequent content DOWN — never tween width/height) + `waterfall-entry` (or `spring-pop-entrance` stagger) on the arriving children
- phone-screen instant swap on the coda tab click → `discrete-text-sequence` (discrete whole-state swap; instant, no in-artifact camera move)
- green verb highlights, model-tag pills, check-circle strikethroughs, yellow forecast cells, edge fade masks → static styling of the surface content — no motion rule needed

**camera modifier**: The blueprint's camera law: **at most TWO real camera moves, bracketing the hinge** — the goldens are emphatic (their briefs carry CRITICAL camera notes). Pick the traversal mechanic first: camera pan (`viewport-change` pan — pan-to-workspace only) OR element scroll (`3d-page-scroll` flat — all others); never both at once. The reveal then spends the second (or only) move: one zoom-OUT to the workspace or one push-IN to the detail (`coordinate-target-zoom`, phases sequenced by `multi-phase-camera`), after which the frame LOCKS — all remaining motion is element-level (typing, expand, screen swap). The feed-rush variant spends zero camera moves: the whole shot is element scroll + expand. This restraint is what separates the shape from `cursor-ui-demo` (camera servos to every interaction) and from `device-surface-showcase` (a showcase camera presenting a held hero).

**Overflow (scrolled/panned surfaces — required for a clean `check`):** the traversal deliberately moves content past the frame edges. Clip at the scene (`overflow: hidden`) AND mark the moving inner layer (the `.page-content` / `.world` wrapper carrying the transcript/feed/document) with `data-layout-allow-overflow` — otherwise `check` reports `text_box_overflow` / `container_overflow` for every row that has scrolled off. The clip handles it visually; the attribute tells the layout audit it's intentional.
