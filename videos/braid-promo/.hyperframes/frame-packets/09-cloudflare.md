narrativeRole: Grounds the claim in real Cloudflare primitives and lands the dev-workload win: the agent runtime ships with the platform.
keyMessage: Native on Cloudflare, agent runtime built in, nothing to host.

Scene 1 (0.0–1.8s): ORANGE register. Ink braid mark (three strands) at center, small. On "native on Cloudflare" (0.58–1.08s) mono kicker "NATIVE ON CLOUDFLARE" above it.
Scene 2 (1.8–5.6s): five mono-labelled nodes spring into an ellipse around the core, each on its word, with hairline connectors drawing to the center → avatar-cloud-network: "WORKERS" (1.88s), "ARTIFACTS · repo per agent" (2.38s), "DURABLE OBJECTS · fence + pi durable" (3.08s), "D1 · issues + audit" (4.08s), "WORKERS AI · clef + gpt-oss-120b" (4.78s).
Scene 3 (5.6–7.6s): on "agent runtime is built in" (6.18–7.28s) a stamp-style ink block "agent runtime: built in" slams under the core (playful slam allowed).
Scene 4 (7.6–9.0s): on "nothing for you to host" (7.98–8.58s) a mono list types beside the stamp and each line is struck through in sequence: "your agent servers", "your job queue", "your retry glue".
Scene 5 (9.0–9.94s): on "Nothing." (9.08s) camera pushes hard into the braid core — the push carries into the zoom-through to frame 12.

## Selected blueprint: constellation-hub

# constellation-hub — Constellation / Hub + Satellites

**intent**: Labeled/iconned nodes spring into a ring/cluster around a center, then the shot resolves on the core — either by pushing the camera INTO the center (depth-of-field collapsing onto it) or by holding a hub mark while the satellites ORBIT it; the "everything connects to / sits around one center" beat.

**roles served**

- Hook (from `hook-cluster-push-in`): a constellation of tool/app nodes springs into a wide ring, then a sustained camera push-in with depth-of-field resolves on the inner core — "it connects everything / one hub for all your tools."
- Social_Proof (from `social-proof-orbit-ecosystem`): the product brand mark lands as the center hub and partner logos spring onto a ring and revolve around it — "plugs into / sits at the center of your stack."
- CTA (from `cta-orbit-collapse`): the ring resolves by COLLAPSE rather than a push-in — category icons drift around an empty central CTA, a cursor click implodes the orbit toward the click point, and the product demo springs OUT of that collapse as the answer (scope → choice → consequence → product).
- Social_Proof (from `proof-logo-chain`): a persistent center logo accrues proofs — its wordmark decodes, a claim ticker swaps, the logo glides to center, then avatars cascade into orbit with drawn connectors while partner logos scroll the bottom strip; four claims read as one statement.
- Social_Proof (from `scatter-drift-finisher`): the ecosystem beat as a
  static END CARD — a two-line serif `[headline]` is the center (no hub mark, no ring), `[~20 app
icons]` pop in scattered frame-wide in a quick stagger, then keep drifting very slowly OUTWARD
  to the end. "Connects to thousands of apps" said with count and spread, not geometry.

**duration**: 5–8s (Hook 5–6s · Social_Proof 5–8s · CTA orbit-collapse ~6s · Social_Proof
scatter-drift end card ~2.5s as a closing beat)

**shot structure**

Consolidated template — nodes ring a center, then one of two finishers resolves on the core.

- Scene 1 (0.0–~1.5s): `[bg]` (dark/space field, optionally slow-drifting diffused gradient blobs). `[primary nodes]` (circles carrying `[icon]` + label) SPRING-POP in (scale 0→1, ~1.15 elastic overshoot, staggered) arranged in a wide ring/cluster around an empty or marked center `[hub]`.
- Scene 2 (~0.7–2.5s, overlapping): smaller `[secondary nodes]` (platform / partner-logo chips) pop in staggered with the same elastic spring, filling the gaps; optional thin `[accent]` connector lines / orbit ring draw from hub→nodes. Camera holds.
- Scene 3 (~2.5–Xs, the resolve): see finisher variant below; lands and HOLDS on the magnified / orbited center to the end.

- Variant — Hook (push-in finisher): from Scene 3, a continuous smooth CAMERA PUSH-IN toward the center inner cluster — inner nodes scale up and stay sharp while outer nodes are pushed toward the edges and progressively BLUR (depth-of-field), background scales up smoothly; holds magnified on the core.
- Variant — Social_Proof (orbit finisher): the center `[brand mark]` snaps in via a quick 3D rotate that decelerates and settles; a thin `[accent]` orbit ring draws around it; `[N partner badges]` spring onto the ring (staggered overshoot) and revolve CLOCKWISE while staying upright, under a continuous slow camera ZOOM-OUT (ecosystem reveal).
- Variant — Social_Proof (optional type-push-through opener, prepended before Scene 1): centered `[headline]` types/slides in with a huge transparent-fill OUTLINE copy of the same words behind it; the outline text scales up exponentially toward camera (high-speed dolly / push-through), breaches the frame, then HARD-CUTS to the hub bg of Scene 1.
- Variant — Social_Proof (scatter-drift finisher, no ring): the center is a two-line serif
  `[headline]` building in place (not a mark); `[~20 app icons]` pop in SCATTERED across the whole
  frame in a quick stagger — no ring geometry, no connectors — then sustain a very slow outward
  drift to the end. Camera fully static: no push-in, no zoom-out; the "everything around one
  center" reads from the drift vectors pointing away from the headline. Often chained as the end
  card of a preceding UI beat (the prior card dissolves into it).

**motion vocabulary**: staggered elastic spring-pop node entrances (~1.15 overshoot); slow gradient-blob drift; connector-line / orbit-ring draw-on; 3D snap-rotate-settle on the hub mark; continuous camera push-in (inner sharp, outer depth-of-field blur, bg scale-up); clockwise orbital revolve of upright badges; continuous slow camera zoom-out (ecosystem reveal); optional outline-text push-through dolly entry. Scatter-drift finisher: frame-wide scattered icon pop-in (staggered, no ring); sustained slow
outward icon drift; in-place two-line serif headline build; static-frame hold to the end.

**rule mapping** (motion verb → `rules/<id>.md`)

- staggered spring-pop node entrances → `spring-pop-entrance` (elastic overshoot) + `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe); 3D-flip-in flavor → `orbit-3d-entry`
- ring / cluster layout of nodes around a center → `avatar-cloud-network` (nodes on an elliptical ring + SVG lines to a center)
- icons on the nodes → `svg-icon-enrichment`
- connector lines hub→node → `svg-path-draw`
- orbit-ring draw-on → `svg-path-draw`
- slow gradient-blob drift → `sine-wave-loop` (idle looped drift)
- 3D snap-rotate-settle on hub mark → `orbit-3d-entry` (3D-flip entry); technique CSS-3D
- clockwise orbital revolve of upright badges → `orbit-3d-entry` (continuous elliptical orbit); technique MotionPath
- camera push-in toward center → `multi-phase-camera` (PUSH-in) + `coordinate-target-zoom` (target the core)
- background scale-up during push-in → `multi-phase-camera`
- continuous slow zoom-out (ecosystem reveal) → `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back) / `coordinate-target-zoom`
- outline-text push-through dolly opener (Social_Proof) → `3d-text-depth-layers` (outline copy behind) + `multi-phase-camera` (push-through)
- depth-of-field blur on outer nodes during push-in → `depth-of-field-blur` (progressive DOF/focus-falloff blur on the off-center outer nodes while the inner core stays sharp)
- frame-wide scattered icon pop-in (no ring) → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group) +
  `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe); positions pre-baked scattered — NOT `avatar-cloud-network`'s
  elliptical ring
- sustained slow outward icon drift → `center-outward-expansion` (outward vectors, slow sustained
  register — drift targets sit slightly past the pop-in positions)
- in-place serif headline build → `gsap-effects` (staggered line/word reveal)

**camera modifier**: push-in-with-DOF (Hook) — `multi-phase-camera` PUSH-in targeted via `coordinate-target-zoom` onto the core; the focus-falloff blur half of it is backed by `depth-of-field-blur`. Orbit finisher (Social_Proof) — slow continuous zoom-out via `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back) while satellites revolve. Scatter-drift finisher (Social_Proof end card) — none: the frame never moves; the outward drift
is element-level.

# Avatar Cloud Network

Avatars on an elliptical ring around a central hub (logo / counter), with SVG dashed lines drawing outward from the hub to each avatar — "community" / social proof. Distinct from [orbit-3d-entry.md](orbit-3d-entry.md) (continuous orbit): this settles into a static composed formation.

## How It Works

Three layers: SVG lines (z-index 1, behind), avatars (z-index 2), hub (z-index 5 — lines terminate AT its edge, never pass through). Avatar positions and lines are built once at setup from ONE shared center; the timeline then runs hub fade → avatar cascade → outward line draw → breathing dwell. Drawing FROM the center is the narrative: "the hub connects to its community."

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<svg class="lines" viewBox="0 0 1920 1080"><!-- lines injected --></svg>
<div class="hub-wrap">
  <div class="hub">{counterValue} {counterLabel}</div>
  <!-- avatars injected -->
</div>
```

```css
.lines {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  z-index: 1;
  pointer-events: none;
}
.hub-wrap {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.hub {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 5;
}
.avatar {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 2;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%); /* centers on the (left, top) the script sets */
  will-change: transform, opacity;
}
```

```js
// CENTER_X/Y must equal the hub's RENDERED center exactly — every avatar
// position and line endpoint derives from it. For a place-items:center hub on
// a 1920×1080 canvas: (W/2, H × CENTER_Y_FACTOR).
const C = { x: CENTER_X, y: CENTER_Y };
const wrap = document.querySelector(".hub-wrap");
const svg = document.querySelector(".lines");

for (let i = 0; i < AVATAR_COUNT; i++) {
  const a = (i / AVATAR_COUNT) * Math.PI * 2 - Math.PI / 2; // start at top
  const x = C.x + Math.cos(a) * RADIUS_X;
  const y = C.y + Math.sin(a) * RADIUS_Y;

  const av = document.createElement("div");
  av.className = "avatar"; // assign image / glyph from authoring data
  av.style.left = `${x}px`;
  av.style.top = `${y}px`;
  wrap.appendChild(av);

  const line = document.createElementNS("http://www.w3.org/2000/svg", "line");
  const attrs = {
    x1: C.x,
    y1: C.y,
    x2: x,
    y2: y,
    stroke: "{lineColor}",
    "stroke-dasharray": "6 8",
  };
  Object.entries(attrs).forEach(([k, v]) => line.setAttribute(k, String(v)));
  const len = Math.hypot(x - C.x, y - C.y); // straight line — Math.hypot, not getTotalLength()
  line.style.strokeDashoffset = String(len);
  svg.appendChild(line);
}

tl.from(".hub", { opacity: 0, scale: 0.8, duration: HUB_DUR, ease: `back.out(${HUB_BOUNCE})` }, 0);

const avatars = document.querySelectorAll(".avatar");
avatars.forEach((av, i) => {
  tl.from(
    av,
    { opacity: 0, scale: 0, duration: AVATAR_DUR, ease: `back.out(${AVATAR_BOUNCE})` },
    AVATAR_AT + i * AVATAR_STAGGER,
  );
});
svg.querySelectorAll("line").forEach((line, i) => {
  tl.to(
    line,
    { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: LINE_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
    LINES_AT + i * LINE_STAGGER,
  );
});

// Climax dwell — out-of-phase breathing holds the eye on the formed network:
// one phase proxy (0 → 2π·BREATH_CYCLES, ease "none"); onUpdate scales avatar i by
// 1 + sin(p + (i/n)·2π) · BREATH_AMP — sine-wave-loop's multiplicative onUpdate form.
// Keep the -50% centering in the same transform write.
```

## Variations

- **Size variety**: vary avatar sizes by a small index-keyed array so the ring doesn't read rigidly repetitive.
- **Solid lines**: drop the dash + draw; lines fade in via opacity — more corporate, less networky.
- **Multi-orbit**: inner ring (fewer, larger) connected to the hub; outer ring is an unconnected "halo."
- **Glyph avatars**: flags / emoji / icons instead of faces — reads "global community" or role spread.

| LINE_DUR       | 0.4–0.7s                     | LINE_STAGGER 0.02–0.05s = a wave outward                         |
| BREATH_CYCLES  | 1.0–2.0 over the remaining s | under 1 = single sigh; over 2 = anxious. BREATH_AMP 0.02–0.06    |

Tokens: dark `{bgColor}` so the cloud reads as a constellation; translucent accent `{lineColor}`; soft border + glow keeps avatars legible on dark.

## Critical Constraints

- **CENTER_X/Y must match the hub's actual rendered center** — when composed with another scene (e.g. a recentered logo), bake them from the same source as the hub's final position, or lines visibly miss the hub.
- **Hub z-index above lines** — lines terminate at the hub edge, never cross it.
- **Lines draw outward** (dashoffset len → 0), starting after avatars are mostly settled.
- **`RADIUS_X > RADIUS_Y`** — a horizontal ellipse reads as perspective; a circle reads flat.
- **Climax dwell ≥ 1s** after lines complete so the formed network is readable.
- Straight lines: `Math.hypot` for length — `getTotalLength()` not needed.
